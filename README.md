This script was created to serve as a master query used for financial and resource management reports.

The source does not have a dynamic table for resource rates and cost centers. Therefor we have to refer to a custom managed look up table to determine the rate and cost center for the respective date range.

This query includes accounting code calculation as well as other calculated fields for financial reports and resource management.
